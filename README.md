Object-Oriented Design Pattern - Prototype

Prototype Payment Transaction Object:
   - Create a prototype payment transaction object with common attributes (e.g., transaction type, payment method, currency).
   - This object serves as a template for new payment transactions.

Benefits:
- Streamlined payment transaction creation.
- Reduced reliance on complex constructors.
- Enhanced code reusability and maintainability.
- Improved application performance by avoiding costly object instantiation.

User Interface Pattern - Getting Input

Integration Throughout the Application:
   - Integrate the Getting Input pattern throughout the application where user input is required.
   - Implement well-designed input fields, forms, and dialog boxes for organized data input.

Benefits:
- Streamlined input of crucial data.
- Simplified user experience.
- Reduced likelihood of input errors through a clear and intuitive design.
